# Excercise 2: FBA simulations and visualization
Now that we have explored the whole model structure it is time to start to use the model for flux balance analysis simulations. 

1. Set the objective function to growth pseudo-reaction, a glucose uptake rate of 1 mol/gDCW/h and run FBA

   * a) Why do we set the Lower boundary to -1 rather than the upper bound to 1?

1. Have a look to the obtained flux distribution

   * a) Display exchange fluxes

   * b) Display internal fluxes

   * c) What this a batch or a chemostat cultivation simulation?

   * d) Was there any limiting compound in the simulation medium?

1. Plot the growth rate vs glucose uptake rate in the range 0 - 100 mol/gDCW/h. Any comments about the results?
